    <h1>@media queries</h1>
    <p>CSS uses the @media rule to detect information about the device being used to access the website. For example, it can be used to detect the size of the device, its capabilities, and its orientation. For this course, we will be using it to detect the
      device size, but keep in mind it is capable of much more.</p>
    <p class="small">Phone: Width <span>less than or equal to 480px</span>.</p>
    <p class="medium">Tablet: Width <span>between 481px and 1023px</span>.</p>
    <p class="large">Desktop: Width <span>greater than or equal to 1024px</span>.</p>
